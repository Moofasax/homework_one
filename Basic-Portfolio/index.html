						This is a bunch of text that is supposed to be about some tall kid with bushy hair named brian lang. I guess if he wanted to say something, he would say he plays guitar, piano, and banjo. He has a parakeet named speckles that sings along to his music as he practices.
					
						Brian majored in physics from James Madison University. During his undergraduate career, he did research at Oak Ridge National Laboratory's Center for Nanophase Material Sciences, where his P.I. was developing a solar cell that would generate power both day and night.
					</p>
					
					<br>
					
					<p>Brian first got into coding with Python and MATLAB for data analysis and visualization. From there his interest in coding took off because he realized he could automate various tasks so he would never have to do them again. Laziness prompts great human advancement!</p>
